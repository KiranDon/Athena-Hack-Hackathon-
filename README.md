# Athena-Hack (Hackathon)

### We have built this project as part of the hackathon "Athena Hack" conducted by [ATHENA SQUARE](https://athenasquare.org)

### Probem Statement:

## Invoice app
- Create a new invoice.
- Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate,
- work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks,
etc.
- Send the invoice via email (does not have to send emails, but if it does, great!)
- View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
- Your backend can be anything and does not have to work. If you would like to use a
mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok).
